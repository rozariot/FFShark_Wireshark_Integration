# FFShark C Drivers

These are a set of C drivers to interface Wireshark with FFShark. These drivers are an alternative to the python drivers ffshark_send_packets.py and ffshark_read_packets.py. These drivers were created to improve performance. 

`libmpsoc.h and libmpsoc.c ` Library containing APIs for setting up the AXI interfaces between the FPGA and the on-chip ARM cpu.

`ffshark_send_packets.c` Sends pre-generated test packets (generated by test_packets.py from the directory one level above) to FFShark.

`ffshark_read_packets.c` used to read packets from FFShark. It then outputs packets into PCAP format so that packets can be displayed on Wireshark. It also takes in user input filtering instructions for Wireshark. Note that this file needs executables compilefilt, sendfilter from the directory above. It also needs the acceptall.bpf filter programming file from the directory above for when the user wants to reset the filter accept all packets.

ToDo's
- The AXI interface API in libmpsoc library still needs to be tested. AXIlite and locking mechanism APIs in libmpsoc have been tested and function correctly
